In the project directory i.e. mernapp, you can run: `npm start` 
This runs the front end made using react in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING ON PORT 3000 as the backend is only allows that port to avoid cors policy errors

Then for the backend part, navigate to mernapp/backend and run `nodemon index.js`. This will run the backend
